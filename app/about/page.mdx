Hey 👋 I'm Xavier, a seasoned **Backend engineer**, and a **Senior Engineering
Manager** @ [Binance](https://binance.com/) - _the world largest crypto
exchange_. I'm originally from France, and currently live in Singapore.

I studied Energy and Mechatronics, thinking programming was lame and robots were
cool. I still find hacking hardware is a hell lot of fun, but one day I learned
how to root my Android phone and _voilà_ ✨ Tech was no longer that blackbox to
consume, I could crack the code and learn to build.

Having a deep interest for economy and financial markets, I developed
macro-level automated trading strategies. Seing positive demand, I
decided to build an SaaS plaform, **Intuition**. But inexperienced younger me
got brought down by regulatory and legal requirements. I packed my hard-earned skills
in `C++`, `Python`, `Go`, `Postgres`, `React`, `APIs`, `Docker` and moved on...

... to **European scale-ups**, taking on responsabilities you don't get in
large corporates, but working with folks and tech you don't find in early
stage startups. This took me to Asia where I kept growing at **Alibaba** and now
**Binance**. Extreme scale companies that still operate at extreme speed.

I Hope you will find a thing or two to learn on this blog. Feel free to connect,
and if you are in Singapore, have mutual interests, or constructive
disagreements, we can share a kopi ☕️
