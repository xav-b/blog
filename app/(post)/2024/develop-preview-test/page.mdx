# The Joke Tax Chronicles [#joke]

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all
day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem:
the kingdom was running out of money.

---

## The King's Plan [#king-plan]

The king thought long and hard, and `finally came up` with a [brilliant plan](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/typography#): he
would tax the jokes in the kingdom.

> "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that
> they should pay for the privilege."

### The Joke Tax

The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king
was firm:

- 1st level of puns: 5 gold coins
  - Second level
  - Still second
- 2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins
- 3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins

As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom.
But there was one person who refused to let the king's foolishness get him down:
a court jester named Jokester.

### Jokester's Revolt [#jokester-revolt]

Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving
jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the
royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.

And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by
Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they started
laughing, they couldn't stop.
