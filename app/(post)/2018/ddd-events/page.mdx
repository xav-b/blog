`TDD`, `Test Driven Development` is quite a thing among developers. On one hand
most of us acknowledge the beauty of the idea and thrive to use it here and
there when new projects pop up with good intentions. But on the other hand this
is one of the first thing we cut when business requirements, lazyness, or
prototyping spirit take over the initial plan. I guess we all have some kind of
partially adapted version of `TDD` at some place in our repository.

So what are we going to talk about here ? What does `DDD` stand for ? A 15th
évolution of some kind of software pattern that will enforce rigorous code while
keeping developers happy and productive ? After all `DDD` is `Domain Driven
Development`, quite the same _look and feel_.

I understand `DDD` like a set of strategies and thinking tools that can help
designing system and manage complexities. You can learn a lot more online and in
this article we won't dive too deep into the theory and roots, although it will
remain mostly a high level reflexion. Instead I want to develop how interesting
it is when architecting cloud applications. We will try to keep it concrete,
talk about integration in existing stacks and especially how it can help
building powerful _event sourcing_ systems.


## Why it's worth it

I'm no expert in _Domain Driven Development_ but I tinkered enough with it to
make my own idea and take the points I thought interesting to include into my
_system design_ toolbox. Basically `DDD` tries to manage technical complexity by:

- Minimizing technical debt - the accidental complexity various factors brought
  into the project. It is often a necessary evil that rushing to MVP (Minimum
  Viable Product) or cutting corners to win market share grow projects into big
  monolith of mysterious mechanisms (what `DDD` calls _[Big Balls Of Mud][1]).
- Controlling inherent problem complexity - the inherent difficulty of solving
  your specific business case. Like [Paul Graham says][2], you are probably
  (hopefully) trying to solve something hard enough that your competitors didn't
  figure out how to outrun you on the market.

How ? Martin Fowler [sums it well enough][3] :

> DDD is about designing software based on models of the underlying domain. A
> model acts as a
> [UbiquitousLanguage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html)
> to help communication between software developers and domain experts. It also
> acts as the conceptual foundation for the design of the software itself - how
> it's broken down into objects or functions.

Thinking about software this way brings a lot of advantages indeed. You can (you
need) to explicitely bound context so that teams can solve specific problems
with specific solutions.

- It becomes simpler : big problems are cut into more manageable one you can
  focus on.
- Everyone go faster, especially on the long term since they can go parallel and
  progress with a clearer understanding of the problems' context.

**Ideally** of course but we will discuss nuances later. All those details let
us recognise the link with cloud applciations. As we said `DDD` provides us with
strategies for modelising problems and design architectural solutions that we
can implement with code and functions. But I do believe the principles hold for
service architectures. Bringing the right people together to think about what
domains need to be modelled and how they interface with each other are a great
playbook for designing services topology.

It is also a good proxy to confirm during development that we serve real
business needs. All too often engineers fall for beautiful architectures where
quicker and less exciting approaches would have been enough. Defining
applications context and usage with other characters and in the perspective of
real life models is certainly a good reality check when we dive too deep into
the technical details.


## Micro-services can help

Unfortunately I met a lot of engineering leaders or `DDD` enthousiasts that
acknowledge the potential but didn't know how to  bring it to their stack. As
[Eric Evans](https://domainlanguage.com/) stated, it is a costly and invasive
process and one really need to both justify the need and make it right. I will
let you judge if your domains need this level of complexity management and if
your software needs those patterns to avoid being quickly brittle. And of course
there are probably other strategies but I did witnessed a common pattern among
those who took the step to make it part of their stack : one service at the
time.

It may sound obvious but it just makes sense. First follow `DDD` advises :
gather people and define your domains. You will probably find opportunities for
new services and then you can design those services in a `DDD` fashion. Simple
as that. Yet powerful because you can recognise all the agile benefits. If you
start with only one service it makes the process of integration easier to learn
for newcomers and easier to iterate on and tweak to the way you already work.
This is also easier to reverse. You still take the risk of calling it off and
regret having lost quite a lot of time, but chances are most of the code will
still be useable and the knowledge gained to identify domains still useful.

What's more, all those patterns and process details will be hidden behind some
kind of remote interface. Being a [CRUD/REST][4] API or a [GraphQL endpoint][5],
the other parts of your stack should be light to modify. And as you design code
following `DDD` practice and decouple clients from core logic, it will become
even simpler.

![architecture](/images/old-articles/ddd-figure-2.png)

This is especially true if micro-services are already in place since you can
recognize the same advantages : smaller and better bounded components that we
can easily modify as long as the other components know how to interface with
them. This notion of interface is key. It is directly linked to the importance
of good bounded contexts in `DDD` and to good decoupling of services in
micro-services. That is one of the great reason I think it makes sense to
integrate them together : they help each other.

It is worth noting that having already in place such architecture doesn't
necessarily mean it will be easier to bring `DDD` on the table. I can think of
three cases :

- Micro services in place. The good news is you probably don't need to develop
  all the bolts and details needed for micro-services to work : service
  discovery, log management, deployment process, … But bad services topology is
  a great technical debt and may be harder to fix since you might be forced to
  move around features between pieces of code that didn't even run on the same
  servers.
- Monolith in place : probably one of the most classic startup-case in 2017. You
  are certainly dying from moving brittle code into it's own service and `DDD`
  will help you a lot. But keep in mind that micro-services come at a price.
  Google develops on only one repository because the coordination between teams
  and the consistency between their applications are really different. Yet
  engineering is about trade-off and `DDD` gives good reasons (technical and
  business wise) for switching.
- Monolith in place (bis) : new features are probably still coming in so get a
  team together and let them design the new service as a squad. All the
  isolation will also force to clearly define the contexts, the scope, the
  models and everything needed to get at the end a new service that they can
  actually present following the principles we mentionned. This is an excellent
  opportunity to assess what they gained doing so, if it worths it and how to
  improve it.

It might be a good transition to talk about teams and business. In real life all
of this comes to serve a business and since `DDD` tries to conciliate languages
of all department we can't skip this detail of course. What makes the idea
really interesting, in my own opinion, is that it could solve a lot of satellite
problems. Communication in companies, like culture, is hard to get right. Having
a common framework to make it easier between departments to talk about the
business issues is really valuable. Engineering can better understand why their
code make sense and how to prioritise. Product owners have an easier time doing
the interface. Sales and executives also better understand where the IT is on
the roadmap and what are the challenges, the expectations.

So spending time to get developers to embrace this philosophy goes further than
just following a new software pattern or strategy. It could help them better
communicate in the company. And it will also give them a great set of tools to
think about solving problems. All the trade offs of micro-services and how to
model problems to solve come into a new light and a new vocabulary under `DDD`.

We insisted a lot on why we need to use it. Let's get a little fancy and push
the idea a little further, in a less obvious and generic area : [event
sourcing][6].

## Match in heaven with Event Sourcing

I will fly faster over this one so I can just reach your curiosity and may be
encourage you to investigate further the opportunity.

Event sourcing is a strategic pattern that enforce thinking your application as
a series of events you need to store any time something changes the state of
your world. This way one can review, understand, replay, debug and do whatever
is required on the history of events. It is more and more discussed today as
data streaming and state management become relevant to modern development. [Read
this][7] if you want to spend well the next hour and get a good understanding of
all the implication and benefits. But this is the kind of idea that powers
relational databases or companies like Linkedin.

![events](/images/old-articles/ddd-figure-3.png)

This is hard to implement but the kind of architecture and tools possible on top
of it makes it worth the effort. And I found out that `DDD` and everything we
said can help. If so far you implemented micro-services that solve a specific
problem by defining clear interfaces, vocabularies and bounded contexts, you are
in a very good spot to look into _Event sourcing_.

The decoupling let you reason about data flow in a clear manner and you can
probably organize it as events triggering actions. This is often implemented as
task queues so in this case you can get started by ensuring you are storing all
the original events and may be for example stop polling for changes and instead
waiting for inputs. As a side note it fits perfectly the kind of values
[lambda][8] architectures offer.

Then the consistent vocabulary defined will help you define what those events
actually are. Technical constraints will come into play (like caching database
queries or limiting connections bottleneck) but you will think about the problem
with the right business goal and context in mind. Then it will be much more
future proof. Basing your reasonning on your core value that remain the same
throughout the product development makes for a consistent evolution.

The integration is also safer for the same reasons micro-services decouple
components. There are a lot of benefits and you will have an easier time
managing teams and building tools on top on architectures that are close to
business knowledge and natural to think about for everyone involved in the
project.



## Conclusion

This was a very theoric post where I essentially reflected on the past months
spent at my current company Kpler working on this kind of approaches. We were
very successful at implementing pieces and bits, here and there, of `DDD` and
`Event Sourcing` where we needed to meet strong requirements in term of data
quality and load. It wasn't easy of course. We had to educate the team on the
new projects, justify the additional time spent on experimentations and
failures. But out of it came stronger services with great flexibility for
integration in our stack and future features.

So I hope it gives you the curiousity to investigate and experiment on your own.
Being a side project or a new service, you will certainely gain great insights
for your future projects by tinkering with those advanced patterns. And given
the time we spent at meetups and events talking with other companies, I am
confident your teams and business will share this output.
