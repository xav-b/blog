[Product Hunt][1] addicts like me might have noticed how often a "developer" tab
was available on landing pages. More and more modern products offer a special
entry point tailored for coders who want deeper interaction, beyond standard
end-user experience. [Twitter][2], [Myo][3], [Estimote][4] are great examples of
technologies an engineer could leverage for its own tool/product.

And [Application Programming Interfaces][5] (API) make it possible. Companies
design them as a communication contract between the developer and their product.
We can discern [Representational State Transfer][7] APIs (RESTful) from
programmatic ones. The latter usually offer deeper technical integration, while
the former tries to abstract most of the product's complexity behind intuitive
remote resources (more on that later).

The resulting simplicity owes a lot to the [HTTP protocol][6] and turns out to
be trickier than one think. Both RESTful servers and clients often
underestimates the value of HTTP historical rules or the challenges behind
network failures.

I will dump in this article my last experience in building an HTTP+JSON API
client. We are going to build a small framework in python to interact with
well-designed third party services. One should get out of it a consistent
starting point for new projects, like [remotely controlling its car][8] !


## Stack and Context

Before diving in, let's state an important assumption : APIs our client will
call are [__well designed__][15]. They enforce RFC standards, conventions and
consistent resources. Sometimes, however, real world throws at us ugly
interfaces. Always read the documentation (if any) and deal with it.

The choice of Python should be seen as a minor implementation consideration.
Nevertheless, it will bring us the powerful [requests package][9] and a nice
[repl][10] to manually explore remote services. Its popularity also suggests we
are likely to be able to integrate our future package in a future project.

To keep things practical, requests will hit [Consul][14] [HTTP endpoints][11],
providing us with a handy interface for our infrastructure.

> Consul, as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in
> your infrastructure.

 Just [download the appropriate binary][12], move it in your `$PATH` and start a
 new server :

```sh
consul agent \
  -server \
  -bootstrap-expect 1 \
  -data-dir /tmp/consul \
  -node consul-server
```

We also need `python 3.4 or 2.7`, [pip][13] installed and, then, to download the
single dependency we mentioned earlier with `pip install requests==2.7.0`.

Now let's have a conversation with an API !


## Sending requests

APIs exposes resources for manipulation through [HTTP verbs][16]. Say we need to
retrieve nodes in our cluster, [Consul documentation][17] requires us to perform
a `GET /v1/catalog/nodes`.

```py
import requests

def http_get(resource, payload=None):
	""" Perform an HTTP GET request against the given endpoint. """
	# Avoid dangerous default function argument `{}`
    payload = payload or {}
    # versioning an API guarantees compatibility
	endpoint = '{}/{}/{}'.format('localhost:8500', 'v1', resource)
	return requests.get(
		endpoint,
		# attach parameters to the url, like `&foo=bar`
		params=payload,
		# tell the API we expect to parse JSON responses
		headers={'Accept': 'application/vnd.consul+json; version=1'})
```

Providing consul is running on the same host, we get the following result.

```py
In [4]: res = http_get('catalog/nodes')

In [5]: res.json()
Out[5]: [{'Address': '172.17.0.1', 'Node': 'consul-server'}]
```

Awesome : a few lines of code gave us a really convenient access to Consul
information. Let's leverage [OOP][18] to abstract further the `nodes` resource.


## Mapping resources

The idea is to consider a `Catalog` class whose attributes are Consul API
resources. A little bit of Python magic offers an elegant way to achieve that.

```py
class Catalog(object):

	# url specific path
	_path = 'catalog'

	def __getattr__(self, name):
		""" Extend built-in method to add support for attributes related to endpoints.
        Example: agent.members runs GET /v1/agent/members
        """
        # Default behavior
        if name in self.__dict__:
            return self.__dict__[name]
        # Dynamic attribute based on the property name
        else:
            return http_get('/'.join([self._path, name]))
```

It might seem a little cryptic if you are not familiar with built-in Python's
object methods but the usage is crystal clear :

```py
In [47]: catalog_ = Catalog()

In [48]: catalog_.nodes.json()
Out[48]: [{'Address': '172.17.0.1', 'Node': 'consul-server'}]
```

The really nice benefit with this approach is that we become very productive in
supporting new resources. Just rename the previous class `ClientFactory` and
profit.

```py
class Status(ClientFactory):
	_path = 'status'

In [58]: status_ = Status()

In [59]: status_.peers.json()
Out[59]: ['172.17.0.1:8300']
```

But... what if the resource we call does not exist ? And, although we provide an
header with `Accept: application/json`, what if we actually don't get back a
`JSON` object or reach our rate limit ?


## Reading responses

Let's challenge our current implementation against those questions.

```py
In [61]: status_.not_there
Out[61]: <Response [404]>

In [68]: # ok, that's a consistent response
In [69]: # 404 HTTP code means the resource wasn't found on server-side

In [69]: status_.not_there.json()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

Well that's not safe at all. We're going to wrap our HTTP calls with a decorator
in charge of inspecting the API response.

```py
def safe_request(fct):
	""" Return Go-like data (i.e. actual response and possible error) instead of raising errors. """
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
	    data, error = {}; one
	    try:
		    res = fct(*args, **kwargs)
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as error:
            return None, {'message': str(error), 'id': -1}

		if res.status_code == 200 and res.headers['content-type'] == 'application/json':
			# expected behavior
			data = res.json()
		elif res.status_code == 206 and res.headers['content-type'] == 'application/json':
			# partial response, return as-is
			data = res.json()
		else:
			# something went wrong
			error = {'id': res.status_code, 'message': res.reason}

		return res, error
	return inner

# update our old code
@safe_request
def http_get(resource):
	# ...
```

This implementation stills require us to check for errors instead of disposing
of the data right away. But we are dealing with network and unexpected failures
__will__ happen. Being aware of them without crashing or wrapping every
resources with try/catch is a working compromise.

```py
In [71]: res, err = status_.not_there
In [72]: print(err)
{'id': 404, 'message': 'Not Found'}
```


## Conslusion

We just covered an opinionated python abstraction for programmatically expose
remote resources. Subclassing the objects above allows one to quickly interact
with new services, through command line tools or interactive prompt.

Yet, we only worked with the `GET` method. Most of the APIs allow resources
deletion (`DELETE`), update (`PUT`) or creation (`POST`) to name a few [HTTP
verbs][16]. Other future work could involve :

- authentification
- smarter HTTP code handler when dealing with `forbidden`, `rate limiting`,
  `internal server error` responses

Given the incredible services that emerged lately ([IBM Watson][21],
[Docker][22], ...), building API clients is a more and more productive option to
develop innovative projects.
