I spent the last six months working on data analytics and machine learning to
feed my curiosity and prepare my new job. It is a challenging mission and I
chose to give up for a while on my current web projects to stay focus. Back
then, I was coding a dashboard for an automated trading system, powered by an
exciting new framework from Facebook : [React][1]. In my opinion, [Web
Components][2] was the way to go and React seemed gentler with my brain than,
say, [Polymer][3]. One just needed to carefully design components boundaries,
properties and states and bam, you got a reusable piece of web to plug anywhere.
Beautiful.

This is quite a naive way to put it of course but, for an [MVP][4], it actually
kind of worked. Fast forward to last week, I was needing a new dashboard to
monitor various metrics from my shiny new infrastructure. Specialize
requirements kept me away from a full-fledged solution like [InfluxDB][5] and
[Grafana][6] combo, so I naturally starred at my old code.

Well, it turned out I did not reuse a single line of code. Since the last time I
spent in web development, new tools, frameworks and methodologies had taken over
the world : [es6][7] (and [transpilers][8]), [isomorphic applications][9],
[one-way data flow][10], [hot reloading][11], [module bundler][12], ...

Even [starter kits][13] are remarkably complex (at least for me) and I got
overwhelmed. But those new toys are also truly empowering and I persevered. In
this post, we will learn to leverage them, build the simplest dashboard possible
and pave the way toward modern, real-time metrics monitoring.


## Tooling & Motivations

I think the points of so much tooling are productivity and complexity
management.

New single page applications usually involve a significant number of moving
parts : front and backend development, data management, scaling, appealing UX,
... Isomorphic webapps with [nodejs][14] and [es6][24] try to harmonize this
workflow sharing one readable language across the stack. Node already sells the
_"javascript everywhere"_ argument but here, it goes even further, with code
that can be executed both on the server and in the browser, indifferently. Team
work and reusability are improved, as well as SEO (Search Engine optimization)
when rendering HTML on server-side.

Yet, applications' codebase can turn into a massive mess and that's where Web
Components come handy. Providing clear contracts between modules, a developer is
able to focus on subpart of the UI with an explicit definition of its parameters
and states. This level of abstraction makes the application much more easy to
navigate, maintain and reuse. Working with React gives a sense of clarity with
components as Javascript objects. Lifecycle and behavior are explicitly detailed
by pre-defined hooks, while properties and states are distinct attributes.

We still need to glue all of those components and their dependencies together.
That's where [npm][15], [Webpack][16] and [Gulp][17] join the party. Npm is the
_de facto_ package manager for nodejs, and [more and more for frontend
development][18]. What's more, it can run for you scripts and spare you from
using a task runner like Gulp. Webpack, meanwhile, bundles pretty much anything
thanks to its loaders. Feed it an entrypoint which `require` your js, [jsx][19],
css, whatever ... and it will transform and package them for the browser.

Given the steep learning curve of modern full-stack development, I hope you can
see the mean of those tools. Last pieces I would like to introduce for our
little project are [metrics-graphics][20] and [react-sparklines][21] (that I
won't actually describe but worth noting for our purpose). Both are neat
frameworks to visualize data and play nicely with React, as we are going to see
now.


## Graph Component

When building components-based interfaces, first things to define are what
subpart of the UI those components are. Since we start a spartiate
implementation, we are only going to define a `Graph`.

```jsx
// Graph.jsx

// new es6 import syntax
import React from 'react';
// graph renderer
import MG from 'metrics-graphics';

export default class Graph extends React.Component {

  // called after the `render` method below
  componentDidMount () {
    // use d3 to load data from metrics-graphics samples
    d3.json('node_modules/metrics-graphics/examples/data/confidence_band.json', function(data) {
    data = MG.convert.date(data, 'date');
    MG.data_graphic({
        title: {this.props.title},
        data: data,
        format: 'percentage',
        width: 600,
        height: 200,
        right: 40,
        target: '#confidence',
        show_secondary_x_label: false,
        show_confidence_band: ['l', 'u'],
        x_extended_ticks: true
      });
    });
  }

  render () {
    // render the element targeted by the graph
    return <div id="confidence"></div>;
  }
}
```

This code, a trendy combination of es6 and jsx, defines in the DOM a standalone
graph from the json data in [`confidence_band.json`][22] I stole on Mozilla
official examples.

Now let's actually mount and render the DOM in the main entrypoint of the
application (I mentioned above with Webpack).

```jsx
// main.jsx

// tell webpack to bundle style along with the javascript
import 'metrics-graphics/dist/metricsgraphics.css';
import 'metrics-graphics/examples/css/metricsgraphics-demo.css';
import 'metrics-graphics/examples/css/highlightjs-default.css';

import React from 'react';
import Graph from './components/Graph';

function main() {
	// it is recommended to not directly render on body
    var app = document.createElement('div');
    document.body.appendChild(app);

	// key/value pairs are available under `this.props` hash within the component
    React.render(<Graph title={Keep calm and build a dashboard}/>, app);
}

main();
```

Now that we defined in plain javascript the web page, it's time for our tools to
take over and actually build it.


## Build workflow

This is mostly a matter of configuration. First, create the following structure.

```sh
$ tree
.
├── app
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── Graph.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
├── build
└── package.json
```

Where `package.json` is defined like below.

```json
{
  "name": "react-dashboard",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "TARGET=build webpack",
    "dev": "TARGET=dev webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0 --devtool eval-source --progress --colors --hot --inline --history-api-fallback"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^5.6.18",
    "babel-loader": "^5.3.2",
    "css-loader": "^0.15.1",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^1.5.2",
    "node-libs-browser": "^0.5.2",
    "react-hot-loader": "^1.2.7",
    "style-loader": "^0.12.3",
    "webpack": "^1.10.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^1.10.1",
    "webpack-merge": "^0.1.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "metrics-graphics": "^2.6.0",
    "react": "^0.13.3"
  }
}
```

A quick `npm install` will download every package we need for development and
production. Two scripts are even defined to build  a static version of the site,
or serve a dynamic one that will be updated on file changes detection. This
formidable feature becomes essential once tasted. But we have yet to configure
Webpack to enjoy it.

```js
var path = require('path');
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var webpack = require('webpack');
var merge = require('webpack-merge');

// discern development server from static build
var TARGET = process.env.TARGET;
// webpack prefers abolute path
var ROOT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname);

// common environments configuration
var common = {
  // input main.js we wrote earlier
  entry: [path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app/main')],
  // import requirements with following extensions
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
  },
  // define the single bundle file output by the build
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'build'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    // also support css loading from main.js
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loaders: ['style', 'css']
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    // automatically generate a standard index.html to attach on the React app
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'React Dashboard'
    })
  ]
};

// production specific configuration
if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    module: {
      // compile es6 jsx to standard es5
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.jsx?$/,
          loader: 'babel?stage=1',
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app')
        }
      ]
    },
    // optimize output size
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DefinePlugin({
        'process.env': {
          // This has effect on the react lib size
          'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
        }
      }),
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
        compress: {
          warnings: false
        }
      })
    ]
  });
}

// development specific configuration
if(TARGET === 'dev') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    module: {
      // also transpile javascript, but also use react-hot-loader, to automagically update web page on changes
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.jsx?$/,
          loaders: ['react-hot', 'babel?stage=1'],
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app'),
        },
      ],
    },
  });
}
```

Webpack configuration can be hard to swallow at first but, given the huge amount
of transformations to operate, this style scales very well. Plus, once setup,
the development environment becomes remarkably productive. To convince yourself,
run [webpack-dev-server][23] and reach `localhost:8080/assets/bundle.js` in your
browser. Tweak the `title` argument in `main.jsx`, save the file and watch the
browser update itself. We are ready to build new components and extend our
modular dashboard.


## Conclusion

We condensed in a few paragraphs a lot of what makes the current web ecosystem
effervescent. I strongly encourage the reader to deepen its knowledge on those
matters and consider this post as it is : an introduction.

Web components, like micro-services, are fun, powerful and bleeding edges. But
also complex, fast-moving and unstable. The tooling, especially, is impressive.
Spend a hard time to master them and craft something cool !
