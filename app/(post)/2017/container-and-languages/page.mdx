In march 2013, Solomon Hykes presents [Docker][1], and democratizes access to
linux containers. The underlying technology, [control groups][2], is already
incubating for a few years at Google. But Docker abstracts away the complexity
of containers' lifecycle and adoption skyrockets among developers. In June 2016,
[Datadog published some compelling statistics about Docker adoption][3]: the
industry as a whole increasingly adopts containers for production.

Since everybody is talking about how to containarize everything, I would like to
take a step back and study how it is influencing the development of our most
fundamental medium : programming languages. Golang rise, Java8 release, Python
3.6 improvements, … How both languages development and containarisation market
maturation play together in 2017 ?


## Container technologies scope

Let's define the scope of what we call **container technologies**. Way back in
2006, two Google engineers started to work on a new technology for partition
hierarchical group of tasks. They called it [cgroups][4] and submitted the code
to the Linux Kernel. This _lightweight_ approach of *virtualization* ([sorry
Mike][29]) was an opportunity for infrastructure-heavy companies and Heroku,
Google, among others, took advantage of it to orchestrate so-called
**containers**. Put simply, they were now able to think of application
deployment as the dynamique manipulation of theses determinist runtimes.
Whatever the code or the business logic, it was encapsulated into a uniforme
execution format.

**Cgroups** are very low-level though, and tooling around the original
primitives quickly emerged, like [LXC][5] backed by [Canonical][6]. Then Solomon
Hykes came in and made the technology widely accessible with [Docker][1].
Possibilities were endless and indeed developers and startups alike rushed in
all directions. Lately however the hype seems to cool down. Docker market share
is being questioned while the company precises [its business strategy][7]. At
the end of the day, developers start forgetting about vendor/technology and just
want simple tooling for more efficient coding. [Docker-compose][8], [Red Hat
Container Development Kit][9], [GC Container Builder][10] or [local
Kubernetes][11] are very sophisticated pieces of technologies that hide the
details of the underlying container mechanics. What they give to engineers is
powerful primitives for advanced development practices : development/production
environment parity, transparent services replication, predictable runtime
configuration, ...

But this is not just about development correctness or convenience, considering
how **containers** are [eating the IaaS landscape][12]. It is also about
deployment optimizations and resilience. Tech giants who operate crazy large
infrastructures developed incredible frameworks, often in the open, to push how
fast they could deploy auto-scalable, self-healing, zero-downtime fleets.
[Apache Mesos][13] backed by [Microsoft][14], or [Kubernetes][15] by Google,
make at least two promises:

- Safe and agile deployments at the (micro-)service level
- Reliable orchestration with elegant service discovery, load-balancing and
  failure management (because one have to accept that production always go wrong
  at one point)

`Kubernetes Overview - lost`

Containers enabled us to manage complexity with infrastructure design patterns
like **micro-services** or **serverless**. Behind the hype of these buzzwords,
engineers try to improve team collaboration, safe and agile deployments, large
project maintainance and monitoring. But we quickly came to realize it was sold
with a _DevOps_ tax. Fortunately the software industry has a hard-won experience
of such balance and we start to see it converges toward the most robust
approaches.

This container landscape overview hopefully gave us the requirements to now
study how it impacted the development of programming languages. We will take a
look first at their eco-systems, and then we will dive in languages designs
themselves.



## Languages Ecosystems and Usages

Most developers are now aware of how invasive container technologies can be. It
makes its way in your development toolbox or how your company manages its
servers. Some will argue that the fundamentals of coding did not evolve much but
the trend is hard to ignore anyway.

`Docker trend over time - lost`

While we are free of course to stay away from Silicon Valley latest fashions, I
think containers tackle a problem most languages struggle with : dependencies
and packaging. Go for example got packaging right but is still trying to figure
out [how to handle dependencies versioning and vendoring][15]. Javascript, on
the other hand, has npm to manage with fine grained third party codes, but build
tools are scattered all over Github. Containers won't spare you the pain of
setting things up (they target runtimes, not build steps), but it can lower the
bar of **language adoption**. [Official images][16] can run most standard
language projects and one can both give a try and deploy a basic _hello world_
in no time. When you realize that Go1.5+ needs Go1.4 to be compiled, it can be a
relief to just `docker run` your 5-lines-long `main.go`.

Growing a language community is a sure way to develop its tooling, libraries, …
But containers also proved to be able to influence how we design those
components. They are kind of the cloud counterparts of the the current
**functional** trend. We tend to embrace a world where both functions and
servers are immutable and single-purpose. We want predictable, pure primitives
(in the mathematical sense). All of that to match increasingly distributed and
intensive workloads.

I hope those approaches come from products need but obviously having the right
technology at hand drives the innovation. As software engineers in 2017 we also
design libraries and tools with containers in mind : [high performance
networking][17], [distributed process management][18], [Data pipelines][19], and
so on.



## Languages design

`Languages Trends over time - lost`

What about languages design themselves ? To get things straight, I don't think
containers influcences how [Guido Van Rossum][20] designs Python. And that is
the point of containers. They abstract the runtime to _let you focus on your
code™_  (it is literally on every Docker-based PaaS landing page). You should be
able to design whatever logic implementation you need, and containers will come
handy to help you run it when needed.

I do believe however that both languages last evolutions and the rise of
containers serve the same maturation of ideas in the tech community.

- **Correctness at compile time** : Both Python 3.6, ELM, and Javascript ES7 are
  bringing back typing to their language (see [type hints][21] or
  [Typescripts][22]) / An application running locally will launch just the same
  in production. You can even [run tests against multiple runtimes without
  complex scripts or heavy setup][23].
- **Simplicity** : Go won a lot of its market share [thanks to its initial
  simplicity][24], taking a lot of decisions for you / Containers try their best
  to offer one unified way to run code, whatever the stack.
- **Functional**: Scala, javascript, Elixir, … all enforce immutable states,
  function compositions with [support for lambda expressions][25], function
  purity / It echoes the _serverless_ trend that promote **function as a
  service**. [Most][26] of [the providers][27] leverage some kind of container
  technology to bring the required agility to their platforms.

There is something elegant having both language features, programmation design
patterns, and infrastructure operations going hand in hand. While I don't think
one of them influences the others, I certainely believe that their development
smooth others' innovations.



## Conclusion

Container technologies and the fame around are finally starting to converge
toward fewer and more robust usages. At the same time, infrastructure designs,
new languages and evolutions of existing ones seem to promote the same
underlying patterns : simple, functional, decoupled components. I think this
coincidence comes from industry maturity and openness, more than, as I said, one
technology influencing the others.

Containers, however, are shaking how we collaborate and design tools for the
languages we love. It changes the way we on-board developers learning a new
language. It change how we setup local development environments, with
micro-replicates of production topology. It changes the way we package and
deploy code. And most importantly, it enabled architectures like
**micro-services** or **lambdas** that influence how we design our programs.

I my opinion programming languages design should continue to evolve decoupled
from containers. They serve different purposes, and given the pace of the tech
industry, major languages should never depends on [new shining tools][30]. That
being said, the evolution of languages now comes a lot with the activity of its
community. What they build, how they use it, how they spread it in companies, …
Coping with containers is an opportunity to bring new developers, improve
production robustness, and accelerate both technical and human growth.
